Absolutely, this is the **checkpoint moment**—a full, consolidated **process audit report** before system state changes become irreversible (e.g., document-user bindings, DB record creation, notification triggers, etc.).

You're asking the right question: **"What exactly should this stage know and report on?"** Let’s define it comprehensively.

---

## ✅ **Full Audit Report Contents – Pre-Finalization Stage**

This report should answer one central question:

> *What happened in this session, what was produced, who is it for, and what remains unresolved?*

---

### **1. Session Metadata**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Session Hash` | SHA256 hash of original import file |
| `Imported File` | Filename + path |
| `Imported On` | Timestamp of import |
| `Validated On` | Timestamp of validation |
| `Document Type` | Inferred document type (e.g., Payment Advice) |
| `Template Used` | HTML template filename used |
| `Mapping File` | Path to column→type mapping JSON |

---

### **2. Dataset Summary**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Total Rows Imported` | Count of records loaded into SQLite |
| `Columns Detected` | List of columns from import |
| `Schema Fields Matched` | Total and per-row match counts |
| `Unmatched Fields` | List of any types the validator couldn’t resolve |
| `Mapping Overridden` | True/False (was `mapping.json` edited?) |

---

### **3. Document Generation**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `HTML Files Generated` | Count + links to each HTML file |
| `HTML Logs HTML Generated` | Count + links to each HTML log file |
| `Summary Generated for HTML` | Link to summary HTML file |
| `PDFs Generated` | Count + links to each PDF file |
| `Summary Generated for PDF` | Link to summary PDF file |
| `HTML Logs for PDF's Generated` | Count + links to each HTML log file |
| `Failed Generations` | List of row IDs or filenames that failed |
| `File Output Path` | Output folder used |
| `Sqlite Database` | Path to SQLite database |
| `Sqlite Tables for session` | List of tables created for session |
| `Sqlite Rows for session` | List of rows created for session |

---

### **4. Entity Matching Results**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Matching Rule Used` | `type_to_column` mappings applied |
| `Matched Rows` | How many documents were matched to users |
| `Unmatched Rows` | How many failed to match (0 or multiple results) |
| `Linked Users` | List of matched `user_id` per row, including method used |
| `Ambiguous Matches` | List of rows with >1 user match |
| `Missing Matches` | List of rows with no user match |

---

### **5. Exceptions and Outstanding Issues**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Import Errors` | Any rows skipped or truncated |
| `Validation Errors` | Field-level issues per row |
| `Mapping Gaps` | Unmapped or invalid entries in `mapping.json` |
| `Generation Failures` | HTML or PDF errors |
| `Match Failures` | Details of rows without a verified user |
| `Pending Resolution` | Any entries marked for manual intervention |

---

### **6. Recommendations or Next Steps**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Ready for Submission?` | Yes / No |
| `Blocked by` | List of unresolved issues |
| `New Entities` | List any new entities that should be created to have all the exceptions resolved |
| `Suggested Fixes` | e.g., "Edit mapping.json to resolve 3 missing fields" |
| `Next Command` | E.g., `link_documents`, `create_user`, etc. |

---

### **7. HTML Report Output**
```plaintext
output/{hash}/www/session_report.html
```
This file acts as the **master summary page**, linking to:
- All per-phase logs (`import.html`, `validate.html`, etc.)
- All document outputs
- All match results
- All unresolved issues

---

### **Bonus: JSON Report for Programmatic Consumption**
```plaintext
output/{hash}/session_report.json
```
This mirrors the HTML report but can be:
- Parsed by the dashboard
- Indexed in a database
- Used for batch audits or metrics

---

### **Would You Like Me To Build?**
- A base `core/reporter.py` that can:
  - Read all relevant artifacts (status.json, mapping.json, linked_users.json)
  - Aggregate summary stats
  - Render a full `session_report.html`
- A default Jinja2-style template for beautiful rendering
- Optional `generate_report` command added to `commands.py`

Let me know, and I’ll assemble it clean and ready.
